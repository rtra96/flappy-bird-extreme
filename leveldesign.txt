~tenative level design~

player must clear 30 pipes per level

level 1: normal mode and parameters

level 2:  introduces 'flame pipes'. fire animation will render for 20% of
 the pipes at random. collision detection window shortens for 'flame pipes'

level 3: 10% more flame pipes rendered;

level 4: in addition to flaming pipes, the speed increases 20% (velocityX)
 after the first 15 pipes. frequency of generated flaming pipes and
 collision detection window remain.

level 5: 20% speed increase from the start of the level, flaming pipe
parameters consistent with level 4

level 6: flappy bird is ablaze with fire animation, 120% speed through
the level; same parameters as level 5, but the user must clear 50 pipes
to win the game.
